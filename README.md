# Data-Science-Capstone
This repository contains my IBM data science capstone project from Coursera. 
The Python notebook will show all the code and data analysis which led to the creation of the report. 
The report will show a detailed walkthrough and analysis of the data collection, cleaning and clustering. 
The presentation is a overview of the report made on powerpoint.
